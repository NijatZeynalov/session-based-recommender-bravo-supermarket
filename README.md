This project harnesses the power of recommendation systems to provide highly personalized and context-aware product suggestions based on users' shopping sessions without the existence of user profiles or their entire historical preferences. This report explores a simple, yet powerful, NLP-based approach (word2vec) to recommend the next item to a user.

Session-based recommendation systems rely heavily on the user’s most recent interactions, rather than on the user’s historical preferences. This is especially advantageous because a user could appear anonymously—that is, a user may not be logged in or may be browsing incognito. The method can be implemented even in the absence of historical user data, and doesn’t explicitly rely on user population statistics.
